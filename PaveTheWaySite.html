        <h2>Home</h2>
        <p>Mission Statement: Concerned by the level of poverty and suffering in Lebanon, we have established Pave the way, an NGO that specifically targets the elderly Lebanese citizens as well as the homeless. Since the economic crisis that became fully apparent in 2019, and the disastrous Beirut blast in 2020, we have been seeing more and more elders in the streets of Beirut. We are deeply touched and troubled by this situation and are determined to do anything to relieve their suffering; we believe our elders deserve better!</p>

        <p class="story-text">Help and support can come in many different ways and doesnt always have to be tangible or monetary. We can also donate our time, attention, and care and sometimes, it matters more than anything else.
Yesterday, while walking around Beirut, we saw the sweetest old man sitting on the bench, feeding a cat with the utmost care.
We couldnt but approach him and ended up talking for more than an hour. We had the most heartfelt and honest conversation about politics,life,family and most importantly the fate of our country.
While talking, the sadness and heartache were taking more and more place, but he would always end every story with a humoristic note. We had tears in our eyes and were laughing at the same time.
He told us his story, about how he prefers walking instead of using his car, that has been empty and parked on the side of the road for the past 10 months. He said it gives him time to reflect and connect with himself and body. He also said that he refuses to let food take control over him and believes in the power of the mind to overcome any challenge life throws at him, especially hunger.
We of course offered to help in any way possible but he categorically refused.
He kept on repeating that refusing help was his way of resisting, and standing up against corrruption.
Although we couldn't be of great help to him, we still enjoyed connecting so much with a stranger. We were so grateful for this small yet very powerful moment.</p>

we have been seeing him frequently on the streets of Badaro for the past months and were never able to help him as much as we wanted.

        </div>
        <p class="story-text">During our first box distribution we met a lot of incredible people, and had the chance to stumble upon a particularly inspiring person.
He was sleeping on the sidewalk, next to Raouche. Two of us had been seeing him laying there from time to time, so we finally decided to come up to him.
We didn’t know how to wake him up without scaring him, so little kids who knew him did it for us while telling us that he was their friend.
He woke up a bit startled and looked at us with sleepy eyes. We introduced ourselves and asked him if he would be interested in a box. He said he would on one condition: he wanted to know if he could share it with the little kids who were there.
We were surprised to see that a man who had nothing, still had more humanity in him than most of us.
We thought we would be helping, but ended up receiving way more from him than what we could have ever expected.</p>
